Welcome to my realm of research—an enthralling journey where science meets innovation!

Within my research, I've dedicated myself to crafting theoretical and computational chemistry tools, unveiling the mysteries of physical chemistry in quantum materials and meta-materials. These explorations aren't just about knowledge but about transforming the future. Imagine shaping cutting-edge technologies like emerging quantum advancements, revolutionizing energy solutions, and paving the way for sustainable progress.

My research unfolds in two compelling realms:

**A. Method Developments:** Think of this as building the foundation—creating powerful tools that decode the secrets of matter, empowering us to push boundaries and redefine possibilities.

**B. Applications:** Here's where theory meets reality. I apply these tools to real-world challenges, channeling their potential to drive innovation across various domains—quantum technologies, sustainable energy, or beyond.

Thank you for joining me on this exhilarating expedition through the realms of science and discovery. Together, let's delve deeper into the boundless potential of research!

## A. Method Developments
   I dive into the realm of computational methods right from the foundational bedrock—embracing 'ab initio' principles. Unlike theories that adapt to existing experimental data, I begin by solving the very fabric of quantum mechanics, unraveling the enigmatic Schrödinger Equations for nuclei and electrons, and plumbing the depths of statistical mechanics to compute materials' properties.
   
These 'first-principles' theories offer a plethora of advantages. Picture this: they open doors to realms beyond experimental reach, shedding light on conditions that elude traditional measurement techniques. They become our guiding light, deciphering discrepancies between different samples or techniques, and even hold the key to architecting brand-new materials tailored for specific properties.

Yet, as with all brilliance, there are limitations. These theories demand computational prowess, and despite harnessing the mightiest supercomputers, their grasp is tethered by the constraints of time and scale. But fear not, for I wield a multi-scale approach—an intricate assembly of theories spanning hierarchies. This approach forms a symphony of knowledge, orchestrating a harmony that paints a vivid picture of these complex multi-scale processes. I engineer cutting-edge first-principle methods in the following areas:

   ### 1. Quantum vibronic effects
   Picture a bustling city within a molecule or solid—where nuclei, like energetic dancers, pulse and sway around their equilibrium positions. Even at the frosty climes of absolute zero, quantum mechanics refuses to let them stand still, introducing what's known as zero-point vibrations—an eternal dance dictated by quantum laws.

  For ages, scientists overlooked this internal ballet, often modeling it with the simplicity of classical mechanics, while their focus remained fixated on solving the electronic Schrödinger equation. But here's the twist: these quantum dance moves of the atomic nuclei hold profound power. They tug and reshape the electronic world, birthing the captivating tale of vibronic coupling—a phenomenon that reverberates across physics, chemistry, and the tech realms. Imagine this: from the fine-tuned symphonies of spectroscopy to the choreography of chemical reactivity and the vibrant canvases of photovoltaics and semiconductor technologies—vibronic coupling takes center stage, altering the very essence of these domains.

  In my quest to reveal these hidden dynamics, I develop two distinctive quantum dynamical sampling techniques—(1) stochastic and (2) path-integral methods. These are not just tools; they're portals allowing us to infuse quantum nuclear vibrations into the very fabric of electronic structure calculations. It's the fusion of these worlds that propels us closer to decoding the quantum dance that shapes our materials and technologies.
