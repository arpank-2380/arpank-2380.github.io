I am happy to share our latest work on quantum vibronic effects on organic molecules and molecular crystals just published in JCTC. Together with PyEPFD and i-PI-Qbox coupling scheme that I have been developing for the last few years, we have benchmarked the state of art methodologies for including quantum effects due to nuclear motion on the electronic properties.
